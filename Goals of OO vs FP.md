- **Not** mutually exclusive
- Principles can be combined
- Modern languages like [[TypeScript]], Scala, C++ 17, Java 8, etc. provide facilities for both paradigms
## OO
- OO seeks to model data entities with *class types*
- *Objects* are concrete instances of a class
- Encapsulation is the principle of limiting access to a class’s members to achieve *separation of concerns*
	- Limit ways that object’s state can be mutated
## FP
- FP seeks to limit complexity by separating data from functions that manipulate the data
- Restrict mutation of data & other [[Functional Programming in JS#Side Effects|side effects]] through [[Functional Programming in JS#Function Purity|function purity]]
